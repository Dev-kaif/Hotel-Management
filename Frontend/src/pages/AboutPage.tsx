          <p className="mb-4">
            Founded in 2015, Luxe Haven began with a simple vision: to create an extraordinary dining experience that combines culinary excellence with unparalleled ambiance. What started as a small bistro has evolved into one of the most sought-after dining destinations in the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our founder, Chef Alexandra Laurent, brings over 20 years of experience from Michelin-starred restaurants across Europe. Her passion for innovative cuisine and dedication to sourcing the finest ingredients remains at the heart of everything we do.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            At Luxe Haven, we believe that dining is more than just a mealâ€”it's an art form and a social experience that brings people together. Every dish tells a story, every ingredient has been carefully selected, and every presentation has been thoughtfully designed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are committed to sustainability and supporting local producers. Our menu changes seasonally to showcase the best ingredients at their peak, and we work closely with farmers, fishermen, and artisanal producers who share our values.
