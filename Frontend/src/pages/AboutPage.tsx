            <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
              Founded in 2015, Luxe Haven began with a simple vision: to create
              an extraordinary dining experience that combines culinary
              excellence with unparalleled ambiance. What started as a small
              bistro has evolved into one of the most sought-after dining
              destinations in the city.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Our founder, Chef Alexandra Laurent, brings over 20 years of
              experience from Michelin-starred restaurants across Europe. Her
              passion for innovative cuisine and dedication to sourcing the
              finest ingredients remains at the heart of everything we do.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gold">Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
              At Luxe Haven, we believe that dining is more than just a
              mealâ€”it's an art form and a social experience that brings people
              together. Every dish tells a story, every ingredient has been
              carefully selected, and every presentation has been thoughtfully
              designed.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              We are committed to sustainability and supporting local producers.
              Our menu changes seasonally to showcase the best ingredients at
              their peak, and we work closely with farmers, fishermen, and
              artisanal producers who share our values.
